# Simple Web Server

In this lab exercise we work together to build a simple web service.

## Getting started

To get started, clone the repository locally and checkout the `1-starter` branch.

Then create an `index.js` file and modify your npm scripts to start `node index.js`.

Add `console.log('Simple Web Server')` in `index.js` and run `npm start` to test that everything is working correctly.

## Hello, world

Express is a framework for building Node.js web applications. We are going to use Express.

First, install Express with `npm install --save express`

Follow the instructions from the [Hello world example](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) in the Express documentation to create your server.

Run, `npm start` and check `localhost:3000` on your web browser.
