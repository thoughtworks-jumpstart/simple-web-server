# Simple Web Server

In this lab exercise we work together to build a simple web service.

## Structure your app

Structuring our app helps make it more organized so we can add new features to it more easily.

Let's move the Express app to its own `app.js` file and import it back into `index.js`.

Make sure to test that your app still works before committing your changes.
